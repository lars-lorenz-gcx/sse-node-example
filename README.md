# Server Send Events NodeJS Example Application

## Get started

This is how to start the application and how to use it. The server will run on port `8000` and the client will run on
port `3000`.

To use the client just open http://localhost:3000 and look into the network tab in the development tools of your
browser. There you should be able to debug the SSE connection to play with it.

### yarn

```shell
yarn start
```

### npm

```shell
npm run start
```
